# Finding Donors for CharityML

Given donors census data, simply find the best algorithms that can train and predict efficiency. Developed a naive classifier to compare testing results. Trained and tested some supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of donations. The best model is selected based on accuracy, F-scoring metric, time spending on training and predicting.

## Project Brief
In this project, you will apply several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with. While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features.
